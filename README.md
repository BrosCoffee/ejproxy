# ejproxy
Challenge:

Create a simple Django project that can parse the table on the Methodologies page of ejproxy.com and save the results into an SQLite database.
Your code should be executable via a command line. Include instructions on how to use it.
Once youâ€™re done, please either push your code into a repository (any will work) and share the link OR zip it up and attach it with your response.
